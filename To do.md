# Things that I'm planning to do

## Inentory
1) Fix torch 6 use logic. Clicking on a half item should add another half first with a second click removing

## Lower section
1) Read the rules and work out how this needs to work

## Rule review
1) Look for rule exceptions not catered for by the current implementation

## Dice roller
1) Set success condition. Review rules for relevant success rolls. e.g., Above X, 3 dice one is above Y, etc,
2) After a roll compare the result to the condition and mark the roll as successful or not

## Hirelings
1) Implement hireling character sheets.

## Conditions
## Turn based rules
## XP
1) Consider missing rules and how they can be implemented in the optimum way.

## GM view
1) GM should be able to see the character sheets of each individual player - perhaps with a single summary page and the ability to navigate to other pages from this, and to be able to make changes to the sheet. Determine how this will work in practice prior to implementation, looking to other projects for inspiration.

### Aesthetics
1) Design a nicer background
2) Look at complimentary colour choices
