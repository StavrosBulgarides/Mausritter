# Things that I'm planning to do

## Inventory
1) Add item search dialog in the Add items list
2) Expose additional item information on the selection dialog such as cost
3) Review SRD to determine whether weapons can be carried in the pack but not count as weapons.
4) Determine how to deal with items that take up two slots
    - Replicate contents to another box
    - Mark one box as having the item + note that the item takes up two boxes, and totally grey out another box to prevent entry.

## Weapons
1) Replicate the ability to add/delete weapons
2) Add a selection list which refers to weapons (only)
3) Add item search dialog in the Add items list
4) Expose additional item information on the selection dialog such as cost
5) Fix weapon box alignmetn to the rest of the inventory

## Lower section
1) Read the rules and work out how this needs to work

## Rule review
1) Look for rule exceptions not catered for by the current implementation

## Dice roller
1) Set success condition. Review rules for relevant success rolls. e.g., Above X, 3 dice one is above Y, etc,
2) After a roll compare the result to the condition and mark the roll as successful or not

## Hirelings
1) Implement hireling character sheets.

## Conditions
## Turn based rules
1) Consider missing rules and how they can be implemented in the optimum way.

## GM view
1) GM should be able to see the character sheets of each individual player - perhaps with a single summary page and the ability to navigate to other pages from this, and to be able to make changes to the sheet. Determine how this will work in practice prior to implementation, looking to other projects for inspiration.

### Aesthetics
1) Design a nicer background
2) Look at complimentary colour choices
